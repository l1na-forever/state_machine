state_machine
=============

Dead simple state machine for programs that mostly manage transitions themselves.

## Installation

    go get github.com/l1na-forever/state_machine

To run included tests:

    cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/l1na-forever/state_machine
    go test

## Status

Functional for my needs. state_machine is capable of:

  - Transitioning between state objects that conform to the State interface
  - Fitting its entire implementation on one screen

In addition,

  - state_machine is [fully documented](https://godoc.org/github.com/l1na-forever/state_machine)
  - state_machine has thorough test coverage

## Quick Start

Start by implementing the [State interface](https://godoc.org/github.com/l1na-forever/state_machine/#State) to set up your various states.

```go
import (
  "log"
  "time"
)

const (
  RunningStateTime = time.Duration(5) * time.Second
)

type IdleState struct{}

func (i *IdleState) EnterAllowed(sm.State) bool { return true }
func (i *IdleState) ExitAllowed(sm.State) bool  { return true }
func (i *IdleState) Enter()                     { log.Println("Entered idle") }
func (i *IdleState) Exit()                      { log.Println("Exited idle") }

type RunningState struct {
  entered time.Time
}

func (r *RunningState) EnterAllowed(sm.State) bool { return r.runCompleted() }
func (r *RunningState) ExitAllowed(sm.State) bool  { return r.runCompleted() }

func (r *RunningState) Enter() {
  r.entered = time.Now()
  log.Println("Started running")
}

func (r *RunningState) Exit() {
  log.Println("Done running")
}

func (r *RunningState) runCompleted() bool {
  // State runs for 5 seconds after being entered
  return time.Since(r.entered) >= RunningStateTime
}
```

Afterwards, the state machine itself can be initialized. Outside of the active state, state_machine maintains no references to the universe of states available in the system; the program should maintain these references itself (as will be needed to call [Transition](https://godoc.org/github.com/l1na-forever/state_machine/#StateMachine.Transition)).

```go
import (
  sm "github.com/l1na-forever/state_machine"
)

// Left here as global for simplicity of the example
var (
  machine      *sm.StateMachine
  idleState    = &IdleState{}
  runningState = &RunningState{}
)

func main() {
  machine, err := sm.NewStateMachine(idleState)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Couldn't set up state machine", err)
  }

  // Transition whenever needed:
  err = machine.Transition(runningState)
  if err != nil {
    log.Println("Couldn't transition to running", err)
  }
}
```

With the full above example, the running state is entered, but never transitions back to the idle state. This is expected; state_machine won't initiate transitions on its own. To complete the example, the running state should signal its own transition back to idle.

```go
func (r *RunningState) Enter() {
  r.entered = time.Now()
  time.AfterFunc(RunningStateTime, func() { machine.Transition(idleState) })
  log.Info("Started running")
}
```

state_machine's usefulness comes into play when another area (or thread) of the program would have made an incorrect transition:

```go
  machine.Transition(runningState)
  // This second transition will fail, resulting in an error, as RunningState's ExitAllowed will return false.
  err = machine.Transition(idleState)
```

**Rather than having a static mapping of allowed transitions, States are given the opportunity to respond to each transition request with a distinct outcome.**
